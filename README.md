# Kosm: A FPS Movement Pack For Unreal Engine 4
FPS mechanics to match the classical Quake franchise movement. This Pack includes 3 characters with distinct movements (which I call CPMA, QW and VQ3), a reimagined mesh creation of a Quake fan-favorite (dm20) plus a smaller map for you to make all of your testing.<br><br>
<strong><i>Current development version:</i></strong> v1.0.8<br>
<strong><i>Unreal Engine compatibility:</i></strong> v4.22.2-v4.22.3<br><br>

<h3>PACK ./patch_notes:</h3>
<strong>v1.0.8 #10-08-2019:</strong><br> Added an extra ragdoll for you to mess up with collision and physics.
<strong>v1.0.7 #09-08-2019:</strong><br> Each character has its own HUD and individual speedometer, which now displays and works correctly when switching characters.
<strong>v1.0.6 #08-08-2019:</strong><br> Removed jump cooldown node so cpma character won't stay glued to the ground when jumping on the edge of a slope or the space between stairs is to narrow.
<strong>v1.0.5 #06-08-2019:</strong><br> tive que aumentar o bound scale das meshes para o mapa aparecer como deve ser no viewport sem aquele glitch branco
<strong>v1.0.4 #04-08-2019:</strong><br> dizer que adicionei Use Flat Base for Floor Check - this avoids the situation where characters slowly lower off the side of a ledge (as their capsule "balances" on the edge.)
<strong>v1.0.3 #03-08-2019:</strong><br>less sloppy when jumping on stairs - added trimp multiplier to stairs too
<strong>v1.0.2 #02-08-2019:</strong><br>Added Character and Weapon Switch capability.<br><br>
<strong>v1.0.1 #30-08-2019:</strong><br>Increased step height so character can step up stairs.<br><br>
<strong>v1.0.0 #27-07-2019:</strong><br>First build deployed.<br>

<h1>Unreal Engine's QoL improvements:</h1>
<strong><i>t.maxfps 300</i> ></strong> When playing the active level in the editor viewport, it caps your fps to the current monitor's resolution rate. To increse the cap, find your console toggle key (go to Edit > Project Settings > type "Console" in "Search Details" field and bind your "Console" key. Now click in "Play" from the main toolbar, click your binded key and write t.maxfps 300 in the opened command prompt.)<br><br>
<strong><i>r.vsync 0</i> ></strong> With your "Console" key already binded, click "Play" and write r.vsync 0<br><br>
<strong><i>Uncheck FOV Scaling</i> ></strong> go into Project Settings and type fov scaling in Search Details, then uncheck it.<br><br>
<strong><i>Uncheck Mouse Smoothness</i> ></strong> go into Project Settings and type mouse smooth in Search Details, then uncheck it.<br><br>
<strong><i>Change Mouse Sensitivity</i> ></strong> go into Project Settings and select Input from the left column, then scroll down until you see "Turn" and "LookUp" inside Axis Mappings, then just change the "Scale" property.<br><br>
<strong><i>Enable Blutilities</i> ></strong> go to Editor Preferences and search for Blutility and check the box to enable it. With Blutilities you'll be able to design several new kinds of tools and workflows based on Blueprints that add new capabilities to the Editor like Scripted Actions (e.g. Bulk Actions), Automation and Editor Widgets. Right-click in Content Browser > Editor Utilities > Blutility/Editor Widget to start using them.<br><br><br>
